The main objective of the project is design a Body Control Module (BCM) with some features using STM32F407VG microcontroller with 32-bit ARM cortex-M4 FPU core processor.  
A control module is a computer component in a car that monitors, controls and uses electrical devices throughout the vehicle. When electric devices began to be used in cars and trucks, each tool was controlled by a different electrical component. There was a cooling module, an interior lighting module, a door lock module, and so on. The body control module combines all these different modules under a single system to work together instead of partitioning, a simple format for both production and problem solving. While there are many different types of body control modules, they are generally the same, the sensors for connecting, switching and automatic switching together in a single computer system. These components are subdivided into inputs, such as sensor data about temperature or speed, and the effects, or the way a computer control system responds to control motor performance. Inputs and outputs are further divided into analog and digital information types - analog signals used by modular continuous modules (such as oil pressure) and digital signals used for modules that can either turn on or off (such as headlights or oil indicator light). 

##Challenges faced and how were they overcome
* Integration of all the features on a single STM32 microcontroller board.
* Hardware implementation on STM32 IDE platform.
